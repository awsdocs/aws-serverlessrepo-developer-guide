# Deploying Applications<a name="serverlessrepo-consuming-applications"></a>

This section helps you learn how to find and deploy serverless applications that have been published to the AWS Serverless Application Repository\. You can browse for applications that are publicly available without having an AWS account by visiting the [public site](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo)\. Alternatively, you can browse for applications from within the AWS Lambda console\.

Some applications have a **verified author** badge, with a link to the author's profile\. An author is considered a **verified author** when AWS has made a good faith review, as a reasonable and prudent service provider, of the information provided by the requester, and has confirmed that the requester's identity is as claimed\.

Before deploying applications from the AWS Serverless Application Repository, see the following topics to learn about application deployment permissions and application capabilities\.
