Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of your AWS solutions\. You should collect monitoring data from all of the parts of your AWS solution so that you can more easily debug a multipoint failure if one occurs\. AWS provides several tools for monitoring your AWS Serverless Application Repository resources and responding to potential incidents, such as the following:

**AWS CloudTrail Logs**  
The AWS Serverless Application Repository is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in the AWS Serverless Application Repository\. CloudTrail captures all API calls for the AWS Serverless Application Repository as events\.
