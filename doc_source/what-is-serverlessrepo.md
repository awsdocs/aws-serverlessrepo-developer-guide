# What Is the AWS Serverless Application Repository?<a name="what-is-serverlessrepo"></a>

The AWS Serverless Application Repository makes it easy for developers and enterprises to quickly find, deploy, and publish serverless applications in the AWS Cloud\. For more information about serverless applications, see [Serverless Computing and Applications](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless) on the AWS website\.

You can easily publish applications, sharing them publicly with the community at large, or privately within your team or across your organization\. To publish a serverless application \(or app\), you can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS SAM command line interface \(AWS SAM CLI\), or AWS SDKs to upload your code\. Along with your code, you upload a simple manifest file, also known as an AWS Serverless Application Model \(AWS SAM\) template\. For more information about AWS SAM, see the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide)\.

The AWS Serverless Application Repository is deeply integrated with the AWS Lambda console\. This integration means that developers of all levels can get started with serverless computing without needing to learn anything new\. You can use category keywords to browse for applications such as web and mobile backends, data processing applications, or chatbots\. You can also search for applications by name, publisher, or event source\. To use an application, you simply choose it, configure any required fields, and deploy it with a few clicks\.

In this guide, you can learn about the two ways to work with the AWS Serverless Application Repository: 
+ [Publishing Applications](serverlessrepo-publishing-applications.md) – Configure and upload applications to make them available to other developers, and publish new versions of applications\.
+ [Deploying Applications](serverlessrepo-consuming-applications.md) – Browse for applications and view information about them, including source code and readme files\. Also install, configure, and deploy applications of your choosing\.
